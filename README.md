# Ok-ish Cabinet

The extension adds a new tab dedicated to your note folder so that you can
get to it from any VSCode windows.

Since VSCode has built-in support for `markdown`, you can write you notes in
`markdown` and preview it with the shortcut: <kbd>⌃ CTRL / ⌘ Command</kbd>
<kbd>⇧ SHIFT</kbd> <kbd>V</kbd>. Also, you can use other markdown-related
extensions to help you get the most out of it.
