# Ok-ish Cabinet

The extension adds a new tab dedicated to your note folder so that you can get to it from any VSCode windows.

Since VSCode has built-in support for `markdown`, you can write you notes in `markdown` and preview it with the
shortcut: <kbd>⌃ CTRL / ⌘ Command</kbd> + <kbd>⇧ SHIFT</kbd> + <kbd>V</kbd>. Also, you can use other markdown-related
extensions to help you get the most out of it.

## Demo

The extension includes necessary operations (i.e., create, rename, move, delete and search) for you to organize your notes.
The experience is not ideal due to the limitation of the VSCode TreeView API, but it gets the job done.
